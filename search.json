There are lots of markup languages such as HTML, LaTeX, RMarkdown, Restructured Text and many more.\nMarkup languages differ from Word Processor software such as Microsoft Word and Google Docs as they separate content, what you are writing, from the style, which is how it looks because you write in ASCII plain text and adorn the text with markers which indicate what it should look like and then apply themes to say what certain features should look like.\nPlain text files have the advantage that they are simple to keep under version control which also means they are easy to work on collaboratively using tools such as GitHub or GitLab."
