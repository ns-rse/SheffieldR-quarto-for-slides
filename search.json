Knuths WEB language was followed by a number of variants most of which worked with his document preparation system TeX. One of these dialects was noweb and noweb underpinned an early integration of Tex/LaTeX and S code (S being the original language specification by Becker, Chambers and Wilks which R is an implementation of) by Freidrich Liesch who wrote and maintained the Sweave package.\nMore recently with the rise in popularity of Markdown, a simple form of markup language and the increase in popularity of R saw the development of RMarkdown which many of you may be familiar with.\nThe last year or two have seen the development of and release of Quarto which is the next iteration and allows embedding of not just R code within the document but other languages such as Python, Julia and Observable a data analysis and visualisation language in JavaScript.\nPart of the flexibility of Quarto is that its underpinned by Pandoc which is a powerful tool for converting documents between different markup languages, including PDF and HTML."

There are lots of markup languages such as HTML, LaTeX, RMarkdown, Restructured Text and many more.\nMarkup languages differ from Word Processor software such as Microsoft Word and Google Docs as they separate content, what you are writing, from the style, which is how it looks because you write in ASCII plain text and adorn the text with markers which indicate what it should look like and then apply themes to say what certain features should look like.\nPlain text files have the advantage that they are simple to keep under version control which also means they are easy to work on collaboratively using tools such as GitHub or GitLab."

This has a number of advantages as you‚Äôll never have to worry about getting your slides to meeting organisers, you just need a working internet connection which these days is fairly common. As a consequence you can keep on working on your slides right up to the last minute (as long as you remember to publish the changes!).\nThere are however a few pre-requisities for using this system, firstly you need an account on GitHub, and if you‚Äôve an academic email address I‚Äôd recommend signing up with that, you get a few more features that are usually reserved for paying customers.\nYou also need a development environment which will help make some of the tasks of editing files and working with Git easier.\nIf you‚Äôre not already set up with one I‚Äôd recommend RStudio and there is a really useful site from Jenny Bryan on how to setup and configure RStudio and Git which I would recommend. There are of course alternatives, personally I use Emacs with Emacs Speaks Statistics and Magit, another popular choice is VSCode, but what you use is somewhat secondary, what I hope to convey to you is the essence of the workflow and the principles of working in this manner.\nPerhaps most importantly a willingness to learn comes in pretty handy, if you‚Äôre new to this approach it will seem frustrating to start with, but persevere, it gets easier and is a lot faster than copying and pasting figures and tables into Word documents and then tweaking them or replacing them when data changes. As Donald Knuth said, its fun!\n\n\nLet‚Äôs Git started | Happy Git and GitHub for the useR"

Linting is the principle of using a consistent style when writing code and markup so that it is easier for others to read and modify and its really important when working collaboratively as might be the case when writing slides in this manner. Simple things like ensuring a consistent line length is used, links are all correctly formatted and so forth.\nConfiguration of the Markdown linting is via the markdownlint-cli2.yaml file and it will automatically fix errors it finds where possible.\npre-commit itself is a Python programme and as such you need to install it on your system, if you‚Äôre using Linux chances are you can install it from your package manager, if you‚Äôre using OSX then you can install it using Homebrew. On either of these operating systems or if you are using Windows you can install a virtual environment, and if you‚Äôre not familiar with this you can see the notes from the course Conda environments for effective and reproducible research.\n\nMore posts on my blog"
