## Overview

+ Background
+ Markdown (very brief)
+ Using a template
+ Writing slides
+ Publishing

::: {.notes}
I thought it might be useful to cover a bit of history with regards to the philosophy that underpins Quarto, then cover
briefly the Markdown language which underpins writing slides before introducing the Template which is available to
kick-start this process.

Then I'm hoping to show how to write and publish slides using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

This _isn't_ an exposition of Markdown and writing Quarto documents, its more focused on working with and publishing
slides on GitHub.

is true when writing documents myself.

::: {.notes}
Quarto has a long pedigree and is the latest form of literate programming. Knuths WEB language was followed by a number
of variants most of which worked with his document preparation system [TeX](). One of these dialects was noweb and noweb
underpinned an early integration of Tex/LaTeX and S code (S being the original language specification by Becker, Chambers and
Wilks which R is an implementation of) by Freidrich Liesch who wrote and maintained the Sweave package.

More recently with the rise in popularity of Markdown, a simple form of markup language and the increase in popularity
of R saw the development of RMarkdown which many of you may be familiar with.

The last year or two have seen the development of and release of Quarto which is the next iteration and allows embedding
of not just R code within the document but other languages such as [Python](https://python.org),
[Julia](https://julialang.org) and [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) a data analysis and visualisation language in
JavaScript.

Part of the flexibility of Quarto is that its underpinned by [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) which is a powerful tool for
converting documents between different markup languages, including PDF and HTML.
:::

## Markdown

+ Simple markup language.
+ Separate content from style.
+ Write in ASCII plain text.
+ Simple to version control.

::: {.notes}
Quarto uses its own dialect of Markdown which is a relatively simple markup language. There are lots of markup languages
such as HTML, LaTeX, RMarkdown, Restructured Text and many more.

Markup languages differ from Word Processor software such as Microsoft Word and Google Docs as they separate content,
what you are writing, from the style, which is how it looks because you write in ASCII plain text and adorn the text
with markers which indicate what it should look like and then apply themes to say what certain features should look
like.

Plain text files have the advantage that they are simple to keep under version control which also means they are easy to
work on collaboratively using tools such as GitHub or GitLab.

## Pre-requisites

Need a few things to get going...

. . .

+ GitHub account (ideally academic `@<somewhere>.ac.uk`).
+ RStudio configured with Git^[[Let’s Git started | Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/)] (or similar
  e.g. [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)/[ESS](https://ess.r-project.org)/[Magit](https://magit.vc) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
+ Willingness to learn!

::: {.notes}
Ok, now that I've covered some of the background and the very basics of Markdown I'm going to move on and hopefully
demonstrate how to use Quarto to write RevealJS slides that are hosted on GitHub and can be viewed in a
web-browser. This has a number of advantages as you'll never have to worry about getting your slides to meeting
organisers, you just need a working internet connection which these days is fairly common. As a consequence you can keep
on working on your slides right up to the last minute (as long as you remember to publish the changes!).

There are however a few pre-requisities for using this system, firstly you need an account on GitHub, and if you've an
academic email address I'd recommend signing up with that, you get a few more features that are usually reserved for
paying customers.

You also need a development environment which will help make some of the tasks of editing files and working with Git
easier.

If you're not already set up with one I'd recommend RStudio and there is a really useful site from Jenny Bryan on how to
setup and configure RStudio and Git which I would recommend. There are of course alternatives, personally I use Emacs
with Emacs Speaks Statistics and Magit, another popular choice is VSCode, but what you use is somewhat secondary, what I
hope to convey to you is the essence of the workflow and the principles of working in this manner.

Perhaps most importantly a willingness to learn comes in pretty handy, if you're new to this approach it will seem
frustrating to start with, but persevere, it gets easier and is a lot faster than copying and pasting figures and tables
into Word documents and then tweaking them or replacing them when data changes. As Donald Knuth said, its fun!

## Quarto RevealJS Template

[Quarto RevealJS Template](https://github.com/ns-rse/quarto-revealjs-template) includes...

+ Sample slides with many examples.
+ [GitHub Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows)to publish pages.
+ Instructions on usage.

::: {.notes}
To make it simple to use this workflow there is a Quarto RevealJS template in my GitHub repository that can be used. It
is based on a workflow my colleague David Wilby originally setup and I used it for slides I prepared for a talk I was
invited to give in Leeds on using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) and the person who invited me turned the code
used to produce the slides into a template. I've then borrowed that back and extended it to its current state.

It uses a [GitHub Work](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows) and the `README.md` on the front page has
instructions on usage and formed the basis of this talk.

## Using Quarto RevealJS Template

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=30%}
+ Go to [Quarto RevealJS Template](https://github.com/ns-rse/quarto-revealjs-template)
+ Make a copy to your account using the "_Use This Template_" button.
+ Give repository a unique name.

## Configuring Repository

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="30%"}
+ Change settings _Settings > Actions > Workflow Permissions > Read and write_
:::
::: {.column width="70%"}
:::
![Changing Workflow Permissions](img/github_quarto_settings_action01.png)
![Changing Workflow Permissions](img/github_quarto_settings_action02.png)
::::

::: {.notes}
A key change after cloning the repository is that you need to change the permissions so that the site will be published
automatically when you push changes to GitHub.

I'll explain more about how this works bit but because this is important and you're in GitHub after using the template I
find it good practice to make the change now so I don't forget to do it later and then end up scratching my head as to
why the slides haven't been published.

So you go to _Settings_ tab along the top, then in the menu on the left selection _Actions > General_. Scroll down and
you can change the _Workflow Permissions_ to _Read and Write permissions_ which allows [GitHub
Workflows])(https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows) to read and write to branches.

## Cloning - URL

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="30%"}

![Getting repository URL for cloning](img/github_quarto_cloning.png)
::::


::: {.notes}
Now that you have copied the template to your account and have a repository of your own you will want to get a copy of
the files locally on your own computer. In Git parlance this is called cloning and on GitHub the green button at the top
of the front page of the repository allows you to copy links to clone a repository.

Whether use use `https` or `ssh` depends on how you've setup RStudio but the safest option is to use `https` (although
long term I would recommend configuring and using SSH keys as they are faster and easier).
:::


## Cloning - RStudio

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="30%"}
+ _File > New Project > Version Control > Git_.^[[Let’s Git started | Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/)]
+ Paste URL `https://github.com/<username>/my_first_quarto_slides`.
:::
::: {.column width="70%"}
:::
![Cloning with RStudio]()
::::


::: {.notes}
You now need to use the URL and clone the package locally. If you've setup RStudio to work with Git and GitHub you can
Open a New Project and then select Git to Clone the repository, pasting the URL in.
:::


## Initial Publish

+ `quarto publish`
+ Creates a special branch `gh-pages` which holds HTML.
+ Pushes branch to GitHub.
+ View slides at
  [https://<username>.github.io/my_first_quarto_slides/](https://ns-rse.github.io/my_first_quarto_slides/)

::: {.notes}
You can publish the slides as they are before doing any editing.
:::

## `_quarto.yaml`

+ Configuration file for slides.
+ Define key metadata (Author, Email, [ORCiD](https://orcid.org))
+ Set common slide properties (e.g. `incremental`, `chalkboard`)
+ Define Footer

::: {.notes}
Configuration of slides if via the `_quarto.yaml` file which allows you to define metadata such as Author, Email and
[ORCiD](https://orcid.org). If you haven't got an ORCiD ID yet I'd encourage you to do so.

You also use this file to define other common slide properties such as whether bullet points are to appear
incrementally, whether to include the chalkboard feature which is enabled for these slides and introduces a button here
to bring up a chalk board which you can write on.

You also set the overall theme and define footers in this file.
:::

## `index.qmd`

+ _Now_ you can write your slides!
+ `index.qmd` is the main file to work on.
+ Template includes many examples.

::: {.notes}
Now you are ready to write your slides!

This is done by editing the `index.qmd` file which, as mentioned is written in Quarto Markdown.

I'm not going to go into great detail about the syntax of Markdown because the template you have cloned includes a
number of example slides with different content and formats such as using columns, embedding pictures and links, ordered
and unordered lists and so forth. Copy and paste the sections you want to use and change.

Instead I'll make a few changes and show you how you go through the cycle of previewing your changes locally, staging
and committing those changes under Git version control and pushing them to GitHub so your slides get updated.

## Speaker Notes

::: {.notes}
A nice feature of RevealJS common to many slide presentation software is the ability to add speaker notes to the bottom
of every slide.
:::

## Previewing

::: {.notes}
Quarto will render your slides locally and start a web-server for you to view the pages _before_ you push them to GitHub.

## Changing Themes

[Blackboard Theme](https://github.com/schochastics/quarto-blackboard-theme)
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column widht="50%"}
Before...

``` {.yaml}
format:
  clean-revealjs:
    incremental: false
    slide-number: true
    show-slide-number: speaker
    auto-stretch: false
```
:::
::: {.column widht="50%"}
After...
``` {.yaml}
format:
  # clean-revealjs:
  revealjs:
    theme: solarized
    incremental: false
    slide-number: true
    show-slide-number: speaker
    auto-stretch: false
```
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
Its straight-forward to change themes by editing the configuration in `_quarto.yaml`.

If the chalkboard feature wasn't enough nostalgia you can use the [Blackboard Theme](https://github.com/schochastics/quarto-blackboard-theme).

You can then preview the slides locally to see what they look like, if you're happy then you stage and commit the
changes to Git and push them to GitHub.
:::

## Linting with `pre-commit`

+ Includes [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hook to lint Markdown.
+ Ensures consistent style used.
+ Configuration via `.markdownlint-cli2.yaml`.
+ Automatically fixes mistakes where possible.
+ [Pre-commit : Protecting your future self](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/blog/pre-commit/)^[More posts on [my
  blog](https://ns-rse.github.io/)]

::: {.notes}
The repository includes configuration to use `pre-commit` hooks to link your Markdown. Linting is the principle of using
a consistent style when writing code and markup so that it is easier for others to read and modify and its really
important when working collaboratively as might be the case when writing slides in this manner. Simple things like
ensuring a consistent line length is used, links are all correctly formatted and so forth.

Configuration of the Markdown linting is via the `markdownlint-cli2.yaml` file and it will automatically fix errors it
finds where possible.

`pre-commit` itself is a Python programme and as such you need to install it on your system, if you're using Linux
chances are you can install it from your package manager, if you're using OSX then you can install it using
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh). On either of these operating systems or if you are using Windows you can install a virtual
environment, and if you're not familiar with this you can see the notes from the course [Conda environments for
effective and reproducible research](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/conda-environments-for-effective-and-reproducible-research/).
